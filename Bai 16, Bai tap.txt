Exercise 5.6
Consider the postings list <4, 10, 11, 12, 15, 62, 63, 265, 268, 270, 400> with a corresponding list of gaps <4, 6, 1, 1, 3, 47, 1, 202, 3, 2, 130>. Assume that the length of the postings list is stored separately, so the system knows when a postings list is complete. Using variable byte encoding: (i) What is the largest gap you can encode in 1 byte? (ii) What is the largest gap you can encode in 2 bytes? (iii) How many bytes will the above postings list require under this encoding? (Count only space for encoding the sequence of numbers.)
1 byte: 127
2 byte: 16383
13 bytes
Exercise 5.7
A little trick is to notice that a gap cannot be of length 0 and that the stuff left to encode after shifting cannot be 0. Based on these observations: (i) Suggest a modification to variable byte encoding that allows you to encode slightly larger gaps in the same amount of space. (ii) What is the largest gap you can encode in 1 byte? (iii) What is the largest gap you can encode in 2 bytes? (iv) How many bytes will the postingslist in Exercise 5.6 require under this encoding? (Count only space for encoding the sequence of numbers.)

1 byte: 1111 1111 = 255
2 byte: 111 1111 1111 1111 = 32767
11 bytes
Exercise 5.8 [⋆]
From the following sequence of γ-coded gaps, reconstruct first the gap sequence and then the postings sequence: 1110001110101011111101101111011.

Exercise 7.5
Consider again the data of Exercise 6.23 with nnn.atc for the query-dependent scoring. Suppose that we were given static quality scores of 1 for Doc1 and 2 for Doc2. Determine under Equation (7.2) what ranges of static quality score for Doc3 result in it being the first, second or third result for the query best car insurance.
Exercise 7.6
Sketch the frequency-ordered postings for the data in Figure 6.9.
